# Simple Location Weather App - Just for fun

This project is a small React SPA that displays a very simple backgorund and weather icon based on the user's Geolocation.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

If you allow access to your Location, you'll get a nice background based on the month of the year and location.
